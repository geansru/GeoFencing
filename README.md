Geofencing notifies your app when its device enters or leaves geographical regions you set up. It lets you make cool apps that can trigger a notification whenever you leave home, or greet users with the latest and greatest deals whenever favorite shops are nearby. In this geofencing tutorial, you’ll learn how to use region monitoring in iOS with Swift – using the Region Monitoring API from Core Location.

In particular, you’ll create a location-based reminder app called Geotify that will let the user create reminders and associate them with real-world locations.
